Here, we review large-scale metabolic network modeling, in particular, stoichiometric- and constraint-based approaches. Although many such models have been reconstructed, few networks have been extensively validated and tested experimentally, and we focus on these. We describe how metabolic networks can be represented using stoichiometric matrices and well-defined constraints on metabolic fluxes. We then discuss relatively successful approaches, including flux balance analysis (FBA), pathway analysis, and common extensions or modifications to these approaches.

Using a reference flux vector of the wild-type (determined experimentally or estimated by an FBA simulation of the wild-type strain), these optimization strategies minimize the adjustment compared with wild-type fluxes. Minimization of metabolic adjustment (MoMA)48 uses quadratic programming to minimize the sum-of-squares difference between mutant and wild-type reference flux distribution. Note that the MoMA solution is not optimal in terms of the wild-type objective. For instance, if the wild-type maximizes for biomass production, the mutant type might not exploit its full growth potential (see Figure 2c). Furthermore, because it depends on an initial nonunique FBA solution, the MoMA solution is also nonunique. Regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM)49 minimizes the number of (significant) flux changes associated with regulation effort. ROOM defines a set of Boolean on/off variables for all reactions. An on state means that the corresponding reaction is upor down-regulated. For off variables, an additional constraint ensures that the mutant flux lies within a predefined interval around the wild-type flux; deviations inside the interval are regarded insignificant. Due to the binary variables, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is used to minimize the number of significant regulation changes (see Figure 2d). Overall, the main difference between MoMA and ROOM is in the motivation behind the approaches. MoMA has a mathematical origin in the formulation of a minimal response to perturbations. ROOM uses a more qualitative, biological approach to control of gene expression, assuming that a cell, in the long run, tries to minimize the number of signifi cant flux changes. ",
