Nature uses 64 codons to encode the synthesis of proteins from the genome, and chooses 1 sense codon—out of up to 6 synonyms—to encode each amino acid. Synonymous codon choice has diverse and important roles, and many synonymous substitutions are detrimental. Here we demonstrate that the number of codons used to encode the canonical amino acids can be reduced, through the genome-wide substitution of target codons by defined synonyms. We create a variant of Escherichia coli with a four-megabase synthetic genome through a high-fidelity convergent total synthesis. Our synthetic genome implements a defined recoding and refactoring scheme—with simple corrections at just seven positions—to replace every known occurrence of two sense codons and a stop codon in the genome. Thus, we recode 18,214 codons to create an organism with a 61-codon genome; this organism uses 59 codons to encode the 20 amino acids, and enables the deletion of a previously essential transfer RNA.

Nature uses 64 triplet codons to encode the synthesis of proteins that are composed of the canonical 20 amino acids; 18 of these amino acids are encoded by more than 1 synonymous codon1 . Synonymous codon choice can influence mRNA folding2 , gene expression3–6 , co-translational folding and protein levels2,7,8 , and has emerging roles9,10. In addition, synonymous codons may have different roles at different positions in the genome11.

Reducing the number of sense codons used to encode the canonical amino acids—through genome-wide replacement of a target codon with synonymous codons (which we term synonymous codon compression)—would address whether all synonymous codons are necessary, and may also provide a foundation for the in vivo biosynthesis of genetically encoded non-canonical biopolymers12.

Up to 321 amber stop codons have been removed from the E. coli genome, using site-directed mutagenesis approaches that commonly introduce large numbers of off-target mutations13–15. Sense codons are commonly more abundant than stop codons by several orders of magnitude, and—in principle—high-fidelity genome synthesis would be the preferred route for tackling their removal. Efforts to alter synonymous codons in individual genes16, genomic regions and essential operons9,16–21 have provided insight into synonymous codon choice, and a subset of these studies have attempted to alter synonymous codons in ways that are consistent with synonymous codon compression17–19,21. However, these previous studies have mutated only a small fraction of targeted sense codons in the genome of a single strain.

There are an extremely large number of theoretical genomes that are formally compatible with synonymous codon compression $\cdot ^ { n ^ { p } }$ , in which $n$ is the number of synonyms for a target codon $n = 2 – 6$ and $P$ is the number of target-codon positions $\check { P } = 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 5 } )$ ), and it is not possible to experimentally test the viability of $n ^ { p }$ genomes. Defined synonymous codons have previously been used17 to replace the target codons in a 20-kb region of the $E _ { \ast }$ coli genome that is rich in both essential genes and target codons; these studies identified simple defined ‘recoding schemes’ that permit synonymous codon compression in this region17. However, it remained unclear whether these schemes could be applied for genome-wide recoding.

DNA synthesis and assembly methods enabled the creation of a Mycoplasma mycoides with a 1.08-Mb synthetic genome22,23, and the creation of 9 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which 1 or 2 of the 16 chromosomes is replaced by synthetic $\mathrm { D N A } ^ { 2 4 - 3 1 }$ (up to $0 . 9 9 \mathrm { M b }$ $8 \%$ of the yeast genome). Replicon excision for enhanced genome engineering through programmed recombination (REXER)—an approach for replacing more than $1 0 0 \mathrm { k b }$ of the E. coli genome with synthetic DNA in a single step—has recently been reported17, and it has been demonstrated that REXER can be iterated via genome stepwise interchange synthesis (GENESIS)17. Here we implement a convergent total synthesis to replace the 4-Mb E. coli MDS42 (ref. 32) genome with a synthetic genome. The synthetic genome is refactored33 and recoded for the genome-wide removal of two sense codons and a stop codon, which creates a synthetic E. coli that uses 61 codons for protein synthesis.

# Design of a recoded genome

We designed a genome in which the serine codons TCG and TCA, and the stop codon TAG, in open reading frames (ORFs) of MDS42 E. coli (Supplementary Data 1) are systematically replaced by their synonyms AGC, AGT and TAA, respectively (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 2, 3). It has previously been shown that this defined recoding scheme is allowed in a 20-kb region of the genome17.

Many target codons are found in areas of overlap between ORFs. We classified these overlaps as $3 ^ { \prime }$ , $3 ^ { \prime }$ (between ORFs in opposite orientations) or $5 ^ { \prime } , 3 ^ { \prime }$ (between ORFs in the same orientation). When the recoding of a $3 ^ { \prime }$ , $3 ^ { \prime }$ overlap could be achieved without changing the encoded protein sequences, the structure of the overlap was maintained and the sequences were directly recoded. Otherwise, we duplicated the overlap and individually recoded each ORF (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Data 4). For $5 ^ { \prime }$ , $3 ^ { \prime }$ overlaps, we separated the ORFs by duplicating both the overlap between the ORFs and the 20-bp sequence upstream of the overlap, which enabled independent recoding of each ORF (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Data 4). Using the defined rules for synonymous

**Diagram a**: This diagram shows the concept of synonymous codon compression. It compares a wild-type genome with a recoded genome. In the wild-type genome, there are three serine codons (TCT, TCA, TCG) and one stop codon (TAA). In the recoded genome, the serine codons are compressed into two different codons (TCA, AGT), and the stop codon is also recoded to TAG. This demonstrates how multiple codons can be reassigned to reduce redundancy.

**Diagram b**: This diagram illustrates the process of refactorying and recoding a wild-type sequence to create a recoded sequence. It shows two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) in the wild-type sequence. After refactorying, the sequence is altered to remove the overlap, and recoding further optimizes the sequence. The recoded sequence results in a non-overlapping arrangement of ORF1 and ORF2, with a duplicated overlap region indicated.

**Diagram c**: This diagram depicts the refactorying process where a wild-type sequence containing ORF1 and ORF2 is restructured. The refactorying step creates a recoded sequence with ORF1 and a synthetic insert between ORF1 and ORF2. The overlap region is maintained, and the upstream part of the sequence is indicated.

**Diagram d**: This is a circular representation of a synthetic genome design with a total length of 3,978,937 base pairs (bp). The genome is divided into sections labeled A through H, each containing multiple numbered segments. The circular layout suggests the continuity and organization of the synthetic genome, with the segments possibly representing genes or other functional elements.

Overall, these diagrams collectively explain the techniques and outcomes of genome recoding, including codon usage optimization, sequence reorganization, and the design of a synthetic genome.]

Fig. 1 | Design of the synthetic genome, implementing a defined recoding scheme for synonymous codon compression. a, The defined recoding scheme for synonymous codon compression. Synonymous serine codons and three stop codons used in the genome of wild-type E. coli are shown (grey boxes). Systematically implementing a defined recoding scheme for synonymous codon compression (red arrows) recodes target codons to defined synonyms, and replaces the amber stop codon TAG with the ochre stop codon TAA. This creates an organism with a recoded genome that uses a reduced number of serine and termination codons (pink boxes). b, Refactoring of $3 ^ { \prime }$ , $3 ^ { \prime }$ overlaps enables their independent recoding. The overlap between two ORFs (ORF1 and ORF2) is duplicated, which enables independent recoding (red box) of these ORFs. c, Refactoring $5 ^ { \prime }$ , $3 ^ { \prime }$ overlaps. The overlap plus 20 bp upstream is duplicated to generate a synthetic insert. When the overlap is longer than 1 bp at the end of the upstream ORF, an in-frame TAA (black box) is introduced in the beginning of the synthetic insert; this in-frame stop codon ensures the termination of translation from the original ribosome-binding site. Thus, all full-length translation of the downstream ORF is initiated from the reconstructed ribosome-binding site in the synthetic insert. This refactoring enables the independent recoding (red box) of ORFs. d, Map of the synthetic genome design with all TCG, TCA and TAG codons removed. Outer ring shows positions (18,218 red bars) of all TCG to AGC, TCA to AGT and TAG to TAA recodings. Grey ring shows positions of designed silent mutations in overlaps (12 green bars), refactoring of $3 ^ { \prime }$ , $3 ^ { \prime }$ overlaps (schematic shown in b, 21 blue bars) and refactoring of $5 ^ { \prime }$ , $3 ^ { \prime }$ overlapping regions (schematic shown in c, 58 black bars). Pink ring shows 37 fragments of approximately $1 0 0 \mathrm { k b }$ in size each. Fragment 37 is shown as 37a and 37b to reflect the final assembly. The sections A to H are indicated.

codon compression and refactoring, we designed a genome in which all 18,218 target codons are recoded to their target synonyms (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Data 3).

# Synthesis of recoded sections

We performed a retrosynthesis—analogous to that commonly used for designing synthetic routes in chemistry34—on the designed genome (Fig. 2). We disconnected the genome into eight sections, each of approximately $0 . 5 \mathrm { M b }$ in length, which were labelled A to H (Figs. 1d, 2a, Supplementary Data 2); we then disconnected each section into 4 or 5 fragments (Fig. 2b). This yielded 37 fragments (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Data 2) that were between $9 1 \mathrm { k b }$ and $1 3 6 \mathrm { k b }$ in length. We placed the boundaries between fragments or sections in intergenic regions that are between non-essential genes. The fragments were further disconnected into 9–14 stretches that were approximately $1 0 \mathrm { k b }$ in length (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Data 5).

We assembled bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) for REXER (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Data 6–9) that contained each fragment, using homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae17,35. For 36 of the fragments, BAC assembly proceeded smoothly (Supplementary Data 10). Fragment 37 was challenging to assemble and we therefore split it into

![](images/011ef70417fa72bd890023ab4a45728d895bf9238e1d3f8e365ea44eeb5fa122.jpg) [Image Description: The image is a schematic representation of a process related to synthetic biology, specifically the creation and manipulation of synthetic and partially synthetic genomes. It is divided into three sections labeled (a), (b), and (c), each illustrating different steps in the process.

Section (a) shows a circular diagram representing a synthetic genome with labeled segments A through H and an origin of replication (oriC). An arrow indicates the division of this synthetic genome into eight partially synthetic genomes, each containing a portion of the original genome.

Section (b) illustrates the process of further breaking down these partially synthetic genomes. It shows a circular genome being divided into a specific section labeled "Section A" and a fragment. The fragment is then used to replace a segment in the E. coli genome, suggesting a method for integrating synthetic DNA into a bacterial genome.

Section (c) details a more complex manipulation involving a BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) containing synthetic DNA. It shows the addition of two homologous recombination regions (HR1 and HR2) to the synthetic DNA. The process involves stretching the DNA to include additional segments, which are then used to replace a segment in the E. coli genome. The final product is a modified E. coli genome with the synthetic DNA integrated, including the BAC ori (origin of replication), URA3 (a selection marker), and YAC ori (yeast artificial chromosome origin).

The key conclusion supported by this diagram is the methodical approach to creating and integrating synthetic DNA into bacterial genomes, which is a fundamental aspect of synthetic biology research. The process involves breaking down and recombining DNA segments to achieve specific genetic modifications.]

Fig. 2 | Retrosynthesis of the synthetic genome. a, Disconnecting the genome into eight sections. The synthetic genome was disconnected into sections A to H, with each section corresponding to approximately $0 . 5 \mathrm { M b }$ (step 1). The position of the replication origin oriC (orange square) is indicated. Sections were assembled into a completely recoded genome (in the forward sense, opposite to the direction of the retrosynthesis arrow) by directed conjugation (Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig. 7). b, Disconnecting genome sections into 100-kb fragments. Sections are further disconnected into 4 or 5 fragments of around $1 0 0 \mathrm { k b }$ in length each. Section A is depicted, and other sections were treated similarly. Nearly all sections were constructed entirely through consecutive REXER steps, by GENESIS (Extended Data Fig. 1). Each step replaced around $1 0 0 \mathrm { k b }$ of wild-type genomic sequence with $1 0 0 \mathrm { k b }$ of synthetic fragment (steps 2 and 3). c, Disconnecting each 100-kb synthetic fragment into 10-kb synthetic stretches. Each 100-kb synthetic fragment is further disconnected into 9 to 14 short synthetic stretches of around $1 0 \mathrm { k b }$ in length (step 4). The BACs that carry 100-kb synthetic fragments (pink) were assembled by homologous recombination in yeast. Each BAC contains Cas9 cleavage sites (black triangles) that enable excision of the synthetic DNA in vivo, homology regions 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) for targeting recombination, and the appropriate double-selection cassette. The $^ { - 2 }$ (sucrose sensitivity, encoded by sacB), $^ { + 2 }$ (chloramphenicol resistance, encoded by cat) double selection cassette is indicated. However different double selection cassettes are used for selection in different steps of REXER. A negative-selection marker $( r p s L ;$ indicated as $- 1$ ) is used to enable loss of the backbone after REXER. BAC and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) origins and a URA3 marker, all for maintenance in E. coli and S. cerevisiae, are indicated.

two 50-kb fragments (labelled 37a and $3 7 \mathrm { b }$ ), which were straightforward to assemble (Supplementary Data 10).

We initiated genome replacement in seven distinct strains using REXER (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The start point for REXER in each strain corresponds to the beginning of sections A, C, D, E, F, G or H (Figs. 1d, 2a); section B was subsequently built on section A. In each strain, the positive and negative selection markers that are introduced in the first REXER provide a template for the next round of REXER, which enables GENESIS17 (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 1b). We found that REXER could be initiated by the electroporation of linear double-stranded spacers generated by PCR (Supplementary Data 11–13) rather than plasmid-encoded spacers17, which accelerated GENESIS. For sections A, C, D, E, F and G, we proceeded with GENESIS in a clockwise direction for 4 or 5 steps of REXER and replaced approximately $0 . 5 \mathrm { M b }$ of genomic DNA with synthetic DNA. We sequenced the genomes of cells after each step of REXER and identified clones that were fully recoded over the targeted genomic region (Supplementary Data 11). Section A was completed first, and we therefore proceeded with GENESIS through section B in a strain that contained recoded section A.

We carried out numerous single-step REXERs with individual fragments (Supplementary Data 11), in parallel with GENESIS, to accelerate the identification of genomic regions that may be challenging to recode. For 35 steps, including all of sections A, C, D, E, F and G, we completely recoded the targeted genomic sequence by GENESIS. However, we observed incomplete replacement of the corresponding genomic region by synthetic DNA for fragment 9 (in section B), and for fragments 37a and 1 (in section H) (Supplementary Data 11).

It illustrates a step-by-step method involving the assembly of partially synthetic genomes. The process begins with four pairs of circular diagrams labeled AB (r), C (d), D (r), and E (d), representing different segments of genetic material. The letters likely denote specific genes or genetic segments, while the parentheses indicate their synthetic (r) or donor (d) origin.

The first step combines AB (r) with C (d) to form A-C (r), and D (r) with E (d) to form DE (d). These combinations suggest the merging of synthetic and donor segments. The next step shows the further combination of DE (d) with F (d) to create A-E (r), indicating another round of genetic assembly. This is followed by the addition of G (d) to form A-F (r), and H (d) to create A-G (r), continuing the pattern of integrating synthetic and donor segments.

The final step in the diagram shows the culmination of these processes with the creation of the synthetic genome Syn61, labeled as A-H. This genome is depicted as a single circular diagram, suggesting that all previous segments have been successfully assembled into a complete synthetic genome.

The diagram does not include any axes, numerical data, or specific genetic details beyond the labels, focusing instead on the conceptual process of genome synthesis. The key conclusion supported by this diagram is the methodical approach to constructing a synthetic genome through the sequential assembly of partially synthetic segments, combining both synthetic and donor DNA to achieve the final product.]  
Fig. 3 | Assembly of recoded genome sections to create Syn61. Synthetic genomic sections (pink) from multiple individual partially recoded genomes were assembled into a single fully recoded genome in the indicated sequence of conjugations. The donor (d) and recipient (r) strains contain unique recoded genomic sections, denoted in pink. The recoded genomic content from the donor was conjugated in a clockwise manner to replace the corresponding wild-type genomic section (grey) in the recipient. Conjugation proceeded until the final fully recoded A to H strain (that is, Syn61) was assembled. Extended Data Figure 7 shows the process in more detail, including all homology regions.

# Identifying and repairing design flaws

Sequencing several clones following REXER enabled us to score the frequency with which each target codon is recoded, and thereby to compile a recoding landscape for the genomic region17. From the recoding landscape with fragment 1, we identified the fourth codon (TCA, Ser4) in map, which is an essential gene that encodes methionine amino peptidase, as recalcitrant to recoding by our defined scheme (Extended Data Fig. 2). We also identified a second region—which encompasses a 14-bp overlap of the essential genes ftsI and murE, and several serine codons in ftsI and murE—that was not replaced by our recoded and refactored sequence. As this region has previously been recoded with the same recoding scheme, duplicating the overlap plus 182 bp rather than the 20 bp used in our synthetic genome design17 (Fig. 1c), the defect in the synthetic DNA for this region is in its refactoring. REXER using a new fragment-1 BAC—which contained both the extended refactoring (Extended Data Fig. 2) and a TCA-to-TCT mutation at Ser4 in map (Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 14)— enabled complete recoding of the targeted 100-kb region of the genome (Extended Data Fig. 2).

From the post-REXER recoding landscape of fragment 9 and additional experiments, we identified five target codons within yceQ as being problematic to recode (Extended Data Fig. 3). Similarly, we identified a single codon at the $3 ^ { \prime }$ end of yaaY in fragment 37a, which was never recoded (Extended Data Fig. 4). yceQ and yaaY both encode ‘predicted proteins’, multiple insertions in yceQ are viable36 and there are no reports in the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) of mRNA production and/or protein synthesis from these predicted genes37. Notably, the codons that are recalcitrant to recoding within yceQ and yaaY all lie within the $5 ^ { \prime }$ untranslated regions of adjacent essential genes, and altering these sequences probably has negative effects on the regulation of these essential genes. Indeed, the target codons in yceQ map to RNA secondary structures and promoter elements within the $5 ^ { \prime }$ untranslated region of rne (which encodes the essential RNase, RNase E)38–41 (Extended Data Fig. 5), and these sequences are essential for controlling RNase E homeostasis41.

We fixed fragment 9 by introducing a stop codon into the $5 ^ { \prime }$ sequence of yceQ, thus minimizing translation but retaining native sequences for regulating rne transcription (Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 14). REXER using this new BAC led to a complete recoding of the corresponding genomic region (Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 11). REXER using a new BAC that contained fragment 37a with a TCA-to-AGC substitution at the problematic codon in yaaY led to a complete recoding of the corresponding region of the genome (Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 14).

Having pinpointed and fixed all the initially problematic sequences, we completed the assembly of a strain in which sections A and B are fully recoded (Extended Data Fig. 6), and the assembly of a strain in which section $_ \mathrm { H }$ is entirely recoded (Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Data 11). This completed the assembly of all the sections in seven distinct strains.

# Assembly of a recoded genome

We developed a conjugation-based strategy42–44 to assemble the recoded sections into a single genome (Fig. 3). Our strategy assembles the recoded genome in a clockwise manner, by conjugating recoded ‘donor’ sections that contain the origin of transfer (oriT), into adjacent recoded ‘recipient’ sections that have been extended to provide homology to the donor (Extended Data Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 15, 16). Following conjugation between the donor and the recipient cells, we selected for recipient cells; we then selected for those recipients that had gained the positive marker at the end of the recoded sequence from the donor and lost the negative marker at the end of the extension in the recipient (Extended Data Fig. 7).

The resulting cells, which contain the recoded sections of both the donor and the recipient, can then be used as a recipient for the next recoded donor, and iteration of the process enables the recoded genome to be assembled through the addition of recoded sections to an increasingly recoded recipient (Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig. 7). Donor cells contained a version of the $\mathrm { F ^ { \prime } }$ plasmid that facilitates transfer of the donor genome to the recipient cells, but which is not competent to transfer itself to recipient cells (Supplementary Data 17). As a result, this $\mathrm { F ^ { \prime } }$ plasmid does not have to be lost from the recipient cells after every conjugation; this accelerated our workflow.

Conjugative assembly (Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig. 7) enabled the synthesis of a synthetic E. coli that we named ‘Syn61’, in which all $1 . 8 \times \mathrm { { \dot { 1 } } 0 ^ { 4 } }$ target codons in the genome are recoded (Supplementary Data 18). The synthesis introduced only 8 non-programmed mutations, and none of these non-programmed mutations affects recoding (Supplementary Data 19); 4 of these mutations arose during the preparation of the 100-kb BACs, and 4 arose during the recoding process.

# Properties of Syn61

Syn61 doubled only $1 . 6 \times$ slower than MDS42 in lysogeny broth (LB) plus glucose at ${ 3 7 ^ { \circ } } \mathrm { C } ,$ and this ratio increased at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and decreased at $4 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Syn61 contains $6 5 \%$ more AGT and AGC codons than are present in MDS42; however, providing additional copies of serV—the transfer RNA (tRNA) that decodes these codons (Fig. 4a)—did not increase growth (Extended Data Fig. 8a). This suggests serV is not limiting. Imaging Syn61 cells suggests that they are slightly longer than MDS42 (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c). We observed minimal differences in the proteomes quantified in both Syn61 and MDS42 (Extended Data Fig. 8d, Supplementary Data 20). Co-translational incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid, using an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACGA pair45–47 targeted to TCG codons, was extremely toxic in MDS42 but non-toxic in Syn61; this validates the removal of TCG codons in Syn61 (Fig. 4b). This approach also provided additional insights (Extended Data Fig. 9a–c). serT encodes the tRNASerUGA, which is the only tRNA predicted to decode TCA codons in E. coli and is therefore essential48. Because Syn61 does not contain TCA codons, serT is dispensable in this strain (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 9d, Supplementary Data 21), as expected. serU and prfA could also be deleted in Syn61 (Extended Data Fig. 9e, f, Supplementary Data 21). These data provide functional confirmation that we have removed the target codons from the genome, show that the cognate tRNAs and release factor can be removed in Syn61, and demonstrate the unique properties of Syn61 that arise from recoding.

Panel (a) is a schematic representation of genetic modifications to a wild-type genome. It shows three scenarios involving the codon usage for the amino acid serine and the stop codon. The top section illustrates the compression of synonymous codons for serine (TCT, TCG, TCA, TGT, AGT, AGC) into a single codon (TCT) using tRNA anticodons (CGA serU, UGA serT, GGA serV, GCU serV). The middle section shows the deletion of tRNAs, and the bottom section shows the deletion of the RF1 release factor, which recognizes the stop codon (TAG). Each scenario results in a "Recorded genome" with altered codon usage and stop codon recognition.

Panel (b) is a graph showing the percentage of maximum growth of two strains (MDS42 and Syn61) in the presence of different concentrations of CYPK inhibitor. The x-axis represents the concentration of CYPK in millimolar (mM), and the y-axis represents the percentage of maximum growth. The graph indicates that the growth of both strains decreases as the concentration of CYPK increases, with Syn61 showing a more pronounced decrease.

Panel (c) is an image of a gel electrophoresis result showing DNA fragments of different sizes. The left side of the panel lists three clones (1, 2, -) and the right side shows the gel with bands corresponding to DNA fragments of approximately 3.0 kb, 2.0 kb, 1.5 kb, and 1.0 kb. The bands are labeled to indicate the presence of specific genetic elements: "ΔserT::PheS*-Hygr" and "Wild-type serT". Clone 1 has both the modified and wild-type elements, clone 2 has only the modified element, and clone - has neither.

Overall, the image suggests a study on the effects of genetic modifications on codon usage and growth characteristics in a biological system, with a focus on the role of specific tRNAs and release factors in gene expression and regulation.]

Fig. 4 | Functional consequences of synonymous codon compression in Syn61. a, Synonymous codon compression and deletion of prfA, serU and serT. The grey boxes show the serine codons and stop codons, together with the tRNAs and release factors that decode them in wild-type E. coli (wild-type genome). tRNA anticodons and release factors are connected to the codons that they are predicted to read by black lines. The tRNA and release factor genes are shown in the black boxes. Synonymous codon compression leads to a recoded genome (pink boxes), in which tRNAs with CGA anticodons should have no cognate codons and serT should be dispensable. All factors that read the target codons should be dispensable in Syn61. b, Co-translational incorporation of the non-canonical amino acid $N \varepsilon$ -(((2-methylcycloprop-2-en-1-yl) methoxy) carbonyl)- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { L }$ -lysine (CYPK), using the orthogonal Methanosarcina mazei pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase $( \mathrm { P y l R S } ) / \mathrm { t R N A } ^ { \mathrm { P y l } } \mathrm { _ { C G A } }$ pair, was toxic in MDS42, but not in Syn61. When provided with CYPK, this pair will incorporate the noncanonical amino acid in response to TCG codons in a dose-dependent manner. In MDS42 (grey), this incorporation leads to mis-synthesis of the proteome, and toxicity. In Syn61 (pink) (which does not contain TCG codons), this is non-toxic. The lines follow the mean of three biological replicates (each shown as a dot) at each CYPK concentration $\mathrm { ~ \textit ~ { ~ O ~ m M } ~ }$ , $0 . 5 \mathrm { m M }$ , $1 \mathrm { m M }$ , $2 . 5 \mathrm { m M }$ and $5 \mathrm { m M }$ ). Percentage of maximum growth was determined by the final optical density at $6 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ (cid:) $\mathrm { \prime O D } _ { 6 0 0 } \mathrm { \prime }$ ) with the indicated concentration of CYPK divided by the final $\mathrm { O D } _ { 6 0 0 }$ in the absence of CYPK. Final $\mathrm { O D } _ { 6 0 0 }$ values were determined after $6 0 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . c, Synonymous codon compression enables deletion of serT in Syn61.

# Discussion

We have created $E$ . coli in which the entire 4-Mb genome is replaced with synthetic DNA; to our knowledge, the scale of genomic replacement in Syn61 is approximately $4 \times$ larger than previously reported for genome or chromosome replacement in any organism (Extended Data Fig. 10a).

We have demonstrated the genome-wide removal of all $1 . 8 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ target codons, and thereby removed orders-of-magnitude more codons than previous efforts (Extended Data Fig. 10b). Our synthetic genome contains only $2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ non-programmed mutations per target codon (Extended Data Fig. 10c), which is orders-of-magnitude lower than the non-programmed mutation frequency in previous recoding efforts14 (Extended Data Fig. 10c).

The creation of an organism that uses a reduced number of sense codons (59) to encode the 20 canonical amino acids demonstrates that life can operate with a reduced number of synonymous sense codons.

Our final synthetic genome was recoded using defined refactoring and recoding schemes, and a recoding rule that was previously determined on just 83 $( 0 . 4 3 \% )$ of the target codons in the genome17. There are a vast number of theoretical recoding schemes and previous work has established that not all recoding schemes are viable16–20; it is therefore notable that it is possible to identify a single defined recoding scheme that—with a small number of simple corrections—allows genome-wide synonymous codon compression.

The strategies that we have developed for disconnecting a designed genome into sections, fragments and stretches, and realizing the design through the convergent, seamless and robust integration of REXER, GENESIS and directed conjugation, provides a blueprint for future genome syntheses. In future work, we will further characterize the consequences of synonymous codon compression in Syn61 and investigate additional recoding schemes. In addition, we will investigate the extent to which our approach enables sense-codon reassignment for non-canonical biopolymer synthesis12.

This enables large sections of the synthetic genome to be assembled through the iterative addition of fragments, which replace the corresponding genomic sequences, in a clockwise manner. The first REXER of a $1 0 0 \mathrm { - k b }$ synthetic fragment of DNA leaves a −1, $+ 1$ double-selection cassette on the genome, which acts as a landing site for the downstream integration of a second fragment of synthetic DNA that contains a $^ { - 2 }$ , $+ 2$ double-selection cassette. In the example shown, $+ 1$ is kanR, $- 1$ is rpsL, $^ { + 2 }$ is cat and $^ { - 2 }$ is sacB, but the same logic can be used with different permutations of positive and negative selection markers on the genome and the BAC.

It illustrates the steps for integrating synthetic DNA into the E. coli genome using a BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) vector.

At the top of the image, there is a diagram of a BAC vector containing two homologous regions (HR1 and HR2) flanking a segment of synthetic DNA. The synthetic DNA includes two regions marked as "-1" and "+1", which likely represent specific genetic modifications or features of interest. The HR1 and HR2 regions are shown in pink, the synthetic DNA in red, and the "-1" and "+1" regions in yellow and blue, respectively.

Below this, the E. coli genome is depicted as a long horizontal line with two flanking regions marked "-2" and "+2" in pink, indicating the areas of homology with the BAC vector.

The process begins with the excision of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by CRISPR/Cas9, as indicated by the arrow pointing downwards. This results in a break in the E. coli genome.

Following the break, the BAC vector with the synthetic DNA integrates into the E. coli genome through homologous recombination. The diagram shows the BAC vector aligning with the broken E. coli genome, with the HR1 and HR2 regions matching the "-2" and "+2" regions, respectively.

The final step, depicted at the bottom of the image, involves the selection process where the recombination event results in the gain of the "+1" region and the loss of the "-2" region. This is indicated by the arrow pointing downwards and the resulting structure showing the synthetic DNA integrated into the E. coli genome with the desired genetic modification represented by the "+1" region.

The key conclusion supported by this diagram is the successful integration of synthetic DNA into the E. coli genome using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination, which allows for precise genetic modifications.]

It is a diagrammatic illustration, not a chart or graph, and it does not contain any numerical data or axes.

The diagram is divided into two main columns, labeled 'b' at the top, with five steps depicted vertically. Each step shows a circular representation of a genome at various stages of modification.

1. **Step 1**: The leftmost circle represents a "WT genome" (wild-type genome) with a segment marked as "-1 +1". An arrow points to the next circle, labeled "Partially synthetic genome with -2 +2", indicating that a synthetic fragment with "-2 +2" has been introduced through a process called "REXER", which results in the gain of "-2" and the loss of "+1".

2. **Step 2**: Another arrow leads to the next circle, which is identical to the one in Step 1, suggesting a repeated process where the REXER method is used again to gain "+1" and lose "-2".

3. **Step 3 to Step 5**: These steps are collapsed into a single arrow, indicating multiple iterations of the process. The final circle at the bottom right represents the "1/8th synthetic genome Section A with -2 +2". A note indicates that this section of the genome is 5 times, or approximately 100kb, and consists of REXER steps.

The process described involves iteratively replacing segments of the wild-type genome with synthetic fragments, gradually increasing the proportion of synthetic DNA. The diagram illustrates a methodical approach to genome synthesis, where specific segments are targeted for replacement in a controlled manner. The use of the term "REXER" suggests a specific technique or tool used in this genetic modification process. The final product is a fraction of the genome that has been synthetically altered, as indicated by the比例尺 (scale) and the specific segments gained and lost at each step.]  
Extended Data Fig. 1 | Using 100-kb fragments of synthetic DNA to replace the corresponding regions in the genome through REXER, and using GENESIS for the stepwise replacement of genomic DNA by synthetic DNA to generate recoded sections. a, REXER uses CRISPR– Cas9- and lambda-red-mediated recombination to replace genomic DNA with synthetic DNA provided from an episome (BAC). This enables large regions of the genome $( > 1 0 0 \mathrm { k b } )$ to be replaced by synthetic DNA17. The black triangles denote the location of CRISPR protospacers, which are cleaved by Cas9 to liberate the synthetic DNA (pink) cassette from the BAC flanked by homology regions. Homology regions 1 and 2 program the location of recombination into the E. coli genome. The double-selection cassette $( - 1 , + 1 )$ ensures the integration of the synthetic DNA, and the double-selection cassette $( - 2 , + 2 )$ on the genome ensures the removal of

Panel (a) shows a graph with a red line representing "Recombining frequency" plotted against a horizontal axis marked in kilobases (kb). The graph has several peaks and troughs, indicating varying levels of recombination frequency across different genomic positions. The position of interest is noted at 83,869 on the genome.

Panel (b) illustrates a schematic of genomic recombination events. It shows three different scenarios labeled "WT" (wild type), "Refactoring 1", and "Refactoring 2". Each scenario includes a representation of DNA sequences with specific regions labeled "ftsI" and "murE". The recombination events are indicated by arrows showing the overlap and upstream regions in base pairs (bp). The color gradient from yellow to red signifies the recombination frequency, with red indicating 100% frequency.

Panel (c) presents a diagram explaining the mapping of small RNAs to a specific region of DNA. It shows two DNA strands with a mapped region between them. The diagram includes a small RNA molecule and a legend indicating the mapping of different codons (Serine, Asparagine, etc.) to their corresponding tRNAs (AGT, AAC, etc.). The legend uses a color gradient to represent the frequency of mapping, with darker colors indicating higher frequencies.

Panel (d) is another graph similar to panel (a), but with a purple line representing "Recombining frequency". This graph also shows peaks and troughs across the kb scale, with a notable difference in the pattern compared to panel (a). The graph suggests a different recombination frequency pattern, possibly due to the changes illustrated in panel (b).

Overall, the image appears to be from a scientific study examining the effects of specific genetic refactoring on recombination frequencies and the mapping of small RNAs to DNA sequences. The key conclusions likely relate to how genetic modifications affect recombination and RNA mapping, as indicated by the changes in frequency patterns and the detailed diagrams of genetic sequences.]  
Extended Data Fig. 2 | Recoding ftsI-murE and map in fragment 1. a, Recoding landscape of fragment 1. We sequenced six clones after REXER. Each dot represents the frequency of recoding within the sequenced clones (y axis) for a target codon at the indicated position in the genome $x$ axis). Black dots indicate positions at which we did not observe recoding. Four codons and a refactoring of ftsI-murE, and one codon in map, were rejected. b, Refactoring the 14-bp overlap of ftsI and murE. The codons and overlaps are colour-coded by their post-REXER replacement frequency in the clones sequenced. Using our initial refactoring scheme (refactoring 1) (in which the overlap plus $2 0 \mathrm { { b p } }$ of upstream sequence was duplicated), we did not observe replacement of the overlap by synthetic DNA (in the six clones sequenced after REXER). Refactoring scheme 2 (refactoring 2) (which duplicates the overlap plus 182 bp of upstream sequence) resulted in complete recoding of this region in 12 of the 16 post-REXER clones that we sequenced. c, Testing   
alternative codons at Ser4 in map. A double-selection cassette, pheS∗- $H y g ^ { R }$ , on a constitutive EM7 promoter was introduced upstream of map, followed by a ribosome-binding site. We replaced the cassette using linear double-stranded DNA that introduces alternative codons (purple bar) at position four, via lambda-red recombination and negative selection for loss of $p h e S *$ DNA with AGC and AGT did not integrate (0/16 clones); we recovered one clone for AGC but sequencing revealed that it contained a mutant AAC (Asn) codon. TCT (6/8), TCC (6/16), ACA (6/8) and TTA (4/8) were allowed. d, Recoding landscape (purple) over the genomic region shown in a, following REXER with a BAC that contained refactoring scheme 2 for the ftsI-murE overlap and TCT at position 4 in map. In total, 2/7 post-REXER clones were completely refactored and recoded, and each target codon was replaced in at least 5/7 clones. The data from a are shown in red for comparison.

Panel a: This is a line graph showing the read frequency across a genomic region. The x-axis represents the position on the genome, ranging from 0 to 110 kilobases (kb), and the y-axis represents the read frequency. The graph shows a fluctuating pattern with several peaks and troughs, indicating variable read frequencies across different genomic positions. Below the graph, there is a schematic representation of a genomic region with labeled segments G2 through G7, suggesting these may correspond to genes or other genomic features.

Panel b: Similar to panel a, this is another line graph of read frequency across a genomic region. The x-axis again ranges from 0 to 110 kb, and the y-axis shows read frequency. The pattern here is different, with a general decline followed by a sharp increase. Below the graph, there is a schematic of a gene with exons (red boxes) and introns (lines), labeled with gene names such as rimJ, yceH, mviM, mviN, yceO, and rluC, indicating the graph may represent read frequencies across these genes.

Panel c: This panel shows a detailed gene map with exons (red boxes), introns (lines), and regulatory elements such as promoters (P1me, P2me, P3me) and a stop signal. The x-axis is labeled with kilobase pairs (kb), ranging from 37.0 to 37.4, focusing on a smaller region than the previous panels. This detailed map suggests the analysis of specific gene regulation elements.

Panel d: This is another line graph with read frequency across a genomic region. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 110 kb, and the y-axis shows read frequency. The pattern here is characterized by a sharp decline followed by a plateau and another sharp increase. The graph does not have an accompanying schematic, but the pattern suggests a specific genomic feature or event, such as a transcriptional start or stop site.

Overall, the image appears to be from a scientific study analyzing gene expression or regulation, with each panel focusing on different aspects of read frequency across genomic regions, possibly to identify patterns of gene expression or regulatory elements.]

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Recoding rne and yceQ in fragment 9. a, Recoding landscape of fragment 9. Our designed synthetic sequence of fragment 9 was integrated into the genome by REXER, and 19 clones were completely sequenced by next-generation sequencing. The recoding landscape graph shows the frequency at which each target codon was recoded across the 19 clones. Although most codon replacements were accepted, recoding of a 26-kb region was consistently rejected; codon positions with a recoding frequency of zero in all the sequenced clones are indicated by black dots. To pinpoint the problematic sequence, $1 0 { \cdot } \mathrm { k b }$ stretches of the genome (labelled G2 to G7) were deleted in the presence of the episomal copy of synthetic fragment 9. The synthetic sequence was sufficient to support deletion of all stretches except G4 (dark grey box), which suggests that an underlying problem is within this stretch. None of the nineteen clones was completely recoded. b, Recoding landscape of stretch G4. After REXER across the 10-kb G4 stretch, and sequencing of 10 clones, the recoding landscape shown was generated. This revealed a clear recoding minimum at yceQ—a ‘gene’ that encodes a predicted protein for which there is little evidence of transcription, protein synthesis or homologues37. All target codons in yceQ were recoded at least once in individual clones, but never simultaneously; thus, the minimum of the recoding landscape does not reach zero, and 0/10 clones were completely recoded. This is consistent with epistasis between the targeted positions. In the map below the recoding landscape, sequences annotated as essential are shown in dark grey and target codons are shown in red. The sequence position $x$ axis) is with reference to a. c, Altered design of the region surrounding rne in fragment 9. Top, original design of yceQ recoding and rne (which encodes RNase E) regulatory sequences. Target codons are shown in red. P1rne, P2rne and P3rne are the promoters (blue arrows) for the essential gene rne; these are found in and around the hypothetical gene yceQ. The $^ { - 1 0 }$ sequence of the major promoter P1rne is mutated by our initial design. The sequences that contains hairpin 1 (hp1) and hairpin 2 (hp2), which bind to RNase E to mediate transcript degradation, are shown as blue bars; these sequences encompass the remaining target codons and are also mutated by our initial design. Bottom, the second codon in yceQ was replaced with a stop codon (purple) and the remaining target codons retained their original sequence. The sequence position $x$ axis) is with reference to a. d, The modified fragment 9 (from c) was integrated on the genome, which resulted in complete recoding in $4 / 5$ clones that we sequenced. The axes of the graph are the same as in a. The recoding landscape for the modified fragment 9, derived from sequencing five clones, is shown in purple. The data from a are reproduced for comparison.

Below the graph is a schematic representation of a gene structure with exons (boxes) and introns (lines), labeled with gene names such as 'dnaJ', 'rpsT', 'yaaY', 'rbf', 'ileS', 'ispA', and 'rpsB'. Arrows indicate the direction of transcription, and the scale bar indicates the length of 2224 nucleotides (nt).

Panel b: This panel is similar to panel a but focuses on a specific region around 40 kb on the genome. The graph shows a sharp drop in read coverage frequency at around 40 kb, which corresponds to a gap in the gene structure diagram below. The gene structure includes 'rpsT' and 'yaaY', with the latter having a highlighted section indicating a possible mutation or variation.

Panel c: This panel presents a detailed gene structure diagram for 'yaaY' with exons and introns. There are two diagrams showing different scenarios of transcription or translation. The top diagram shows the normal gene structure, while the bottom diagram includes a mutation indicated by 'Hyg^r', which suggests the presence of a hygromycin resistance gene. There is also a legend explaining the color coding for different types of mutations: TCC (Ser) to AGT (Ser) with varying frequencies of occurrence (0/16, 2/16, 2/16, 6/16, 9/16).

Panel d: This panel shows two graphs with read coverage frequency. The top graph has a purple line representing read coverage across the genome, and the bottom graph has a pink line. Both graphs show fluctuations in read coverage frequency, with the bottom graph having a more pronounced drop in coverage at around 40 kb. The x-axis is the same as in the previous panels, and the y-axis represents read coverage frequency. The gene structure below the graphs includes 'rpsT' and 'yaaY', with the latter having a highlighted section similar to panel b.

Overall, the image appears to be from a scientific study analyzing gene expression or regulation, possibly focusing on the effects of mutations on gene expression. The key conclusions likely involve the impact of specific mutations on read coverage and gene structure, as indicated by the highlighted sections and the color-coded mutation frequencies.]

Extended Data Fig. 4 | Recoding yaaY in fragment 37a. a, Recoding landscape of fragment 37a. Our designed synthetic sequence of fragment 37a was integrated into the genome by REXER, and six clones were completely sequenced by next-generation sequencing. Although most codon replacements were accepted, recoding of a 6.5-kb region was consistently rejected. Target-codon positions that were never recoded in the six clones sequenced are indicated by black dots. b, Identification of the problematic target codon. Within the identified 6.5-kb problematic region, we first focused on codons in essential genes (dark grey arrows) rather than non-essential genes (light grey arrows). Sanger sequencing (black bar) of 24 clones showed that 2 clones were recoded in all 6 target codons within a sub-section of the essential genes. Further Sanger sequencing of the remaining target codons in essential genes in these two clones revealed that 1 clone was recoded at all 17 target codons. This clone was completely sequenced by next-generation sequencing and used to generate a recoding landscape, in which each target codon is either recoded (red) or not recoded (black). In combination with the recoding landscape in a, this enabled us to identify a problematic region $1 . 8 \mathrm { - k b }$ upstream of ribF. Here we focused on the four target codons in the genes rpsT and yaaY as the nearest codons to the essential ribF gene. Sanger

sequencing of 33 clones across this sequence revealed only 1 codon that was never recoded—the codon for Ser70 in the hypothetical gene yaaY (sequencing results are shown as colour-coded on the gene map of rspT and yaaY). We therefore investigated alternative codon replacements in yaaY. c, Alternative codon replacement in the hypothetical gene yaaY. At position Ser70 in this gene, replacement of TCA with AGT was not successful. To investigate alternative codon replacement schemes, a double-selection marker $( p h e S * - H y g ^ { R } )$ on a constitutive EM7 promoter, followed by a ribosome-binding site, was introduced into yaaY, 12 bp upstream of the codon for Ser70. The negative-selection marker was then used to select for clones that had replaced the cassette using linear doublestranded DNA that introduces alternative codons (purple bar) at position 70, via lambda-red recombination. Although linear double-stranded DNA with AGT did not integrate (0/16 clones), integration of double-stranded DNA with TCC (2/16), TCG (2/16), TCT (6/16) and AGC (9/16) proved viable. d, Recoding landscape following REXER with a BAC that contains a corrected version of fragment 37a, bearing AGC at position Ser70 in the hypothetical gene yaaY (purple). When integrated by REXER, we identified 1/7 completely recoded clones. AGC at position Ser70 in yaaY was introduced in 4/7 clones.

It is divided into two main sections: the top section shows a DNA sequence with annotations, and the bottom section shows RNA secondary structures.

**Top Section:**
- The top section displays a DNA sequence with two strands running in opposite directions, indicated by arrows. The sequence is annotated with a transcription start site (P rime tss) and a transcription factor binding site (yceQ).
- The DNA sequence is shown with a highlighted section where a synonymous codon compression has occurred. This is indicated by a red box and the words "Synonymous codon compression."
- The sequence is flanked by two gene annotations, "yceQ" on the left and right sides, suggesting that the highlighted region is within the yceQ gene.

**Bottom Section:**
- The bottom section shows RNA secondary structures resulting from the transcription of the DNA sequence above. There are three different structures labeled hp1, hp2, and hp3.
- Each structure is composed of RNA helices (represented by lines connecting base pairs) and loops. The helices are labeled with "hp" followed by a number (e.g., hp3A, hp3B, hp3C, hp3D), indicating different helices within the structure.
- The RNA sequences are shown in a linear format below the secondary structures, with the start (SD) and end of the sequence indicated.
- The RNA sequences contain nucleotide bases (A, U, G, C) and are aligned with the corresponding helices in the secondary structures above.

**Key Conclusions:**
- The diagram suggests a study of how DNA sequence variations (synonymous codon compression) affect RNA secondary structure and potentially gene expression.
- The different RNA secondary structures (hp1, hp2, hp3) may represent different conformations that the RNA can adopt, which could influence its function or stability.

Overall, the image is a detailed representation of the relationship between DNA sequence, transcription, and RNA structure, highlighting the impact of sequence changes on RNA folding and potentially on gene regulation.]  
Extended Data Fig. 5 | Substitutions in the hypothetical gene yceQ overlap with regulatory elements in rne. a, In our original design, a programmed substitution of a TCA (blue) to AGT (red) in the hypothetical gene yceQ leads to mutation of the $^ { - 1 0 }$ region of the P1rne promoter (boxed). The transcriptional start site (tss) of this promoter for rne transcription is indicated by an arrow; this is the major promoter for rne transcription. b, Target-codon substitutions overlap with and may

potentially disrupt the key regulatory hairpins (hp2 and hp3) in the long $5 ^ { \prime }$ untranslated region of the rne transcript. hp2 and hp3 mediate a regulatory feedback loop, in which RNase E is recruited to the mRNA to promote degradation of its own transcript. A schematic of the wild-type secondary structure of the rne $5 ^ { \prime }$ untranslated region is shown40. The target codons for synonymous replacement are highlighted in blue.

It is a flowchart that outlines the stages of gene splicing and repair, which are common techniques in genetic engineering.

At the top of the image, there are three sections labeled A, B, and C, which represent different parts of a gene. Section H is indicated at the far left, suggesting it is the starting point of the gene sequence. Each section contains numbered segments, with some segments highlighted in different colors, indicating specific genes or regions of interest.

The process begins with the integration of oriT, which is a specific DNA sequence that allows for conjugation, a process where genetic material is transferred between cells. This integration is shown to occur between segments 8 and 9.

Following this, there is a repair of fragment 9, which is indicated by the arrow pointing to the next step where segment 9 is replaced with a different sequence, labeled as pH. This suggests that a new genetic element is being introduced into the gene sequence.

The next step involves the conjugation of segments 10-13 into segments 4-9. This is depicted by an arrow pointing to the final sequence at the bottom of the image, which shows the completed sections A and B of the gene.

The key conclusion supported by this diagram is the successful manipulation and recombination of specific gene segments to achieve a desired genetic modification. The process involves precise cutting, splicing, and repair of DNA sequences, which is fundamental in genetic engineering for creating genetically modified organisms or for research purposes.

Overall, the image serves as a visual guide to understanding the complex steps involved in genetic manipulation, highlighting the integration of new DNA sequences and the repair of existing ones to achieve the final modified gene sequence.]

It is divided into two main sections, each depicting a different part of the process.

On the left side, the process begins with a DNA fragment labeled "37a" that has a single-strand break (ssC). The repair of this fragment is indicated by an arrow pointing to the next step, where the fragment is now labeled "37a" with a repair patch. Below this, the term "REXER" is noted, which likely refers to a specific enzyme or method used for recombination or repair. The final step on the left shows the recombination of the repaired fragment "37a" with another fragment "37b" to form a new DNA molecule.

On the right side, the process starts with a DNA fragment labeled "1" that also has a single-strand break (ssC). The repair of this fragment is indicated by an arrow pointing to the next step, where the fragment is now labeled "1" with a repair patch. The term "GENESIS" is noted, which may refer to a specific technique or tool used for genetic manipulation. Below this, the DNA fragment "1" is shown to be integrated into a larger DNA molecule labeled "2" and "3", which are part of a construct that includes an origin of transfer (oriT) for conjugation. The final step on the right shows the conjugation of fragments "1-3" into the previously mentioned "37a-37b" DNA molecule.

The overall process depicted in the image involves the repair of DNA fragments, their recombination, and integration into larger DNA constructs, which is a common procedure in genetic engineering and molecular biology. The image does not contain any numerical data or axes, so it does not support any specific quantitative conclusions but rather illustrates the qualitative steps of the genetic manipulation process.]  
Completion of Section H

Extended Data Fig. 6 | Completing sections A, B and H. a, GENESIS was initiated with fragment 4 and proceeded smoothly until fragment 9, in which we were unable to recode yceQ. Identifying and fixing the problems with our initial design of fragment 9 was carried out as described in Extended Data Fig. 3, by introducing a stop codon (yellow line) at the start of the predicted yceQ ORF. Following a swap of the sacB-cat (sC) double-selection cassette at the end of fragment 9 for a pheS∗-HygR (pH) double selection cassette, this strain was ready to act as the recipient for conjugation to assemble a strain in which fragments 4–13 (section A plus section B) are fully recoded. In parallel, we continued to recode the strain that contains the recoded fragment 4 to incomplete fragment 9 by GENESIS; this generated a second strain for assembly in which fragments 4–8 and 10–13 were completely recoded, and fragment 9 was partially recoded. We then integrated oriT (white triangle) $\bar { 3 } \mathrm { k b }$ upstream of the start of fragment 10 in the second strain to generate a donor for

conjugation, to assemble a strain in which fragments 4–13 (section A plus section B) are fully recoded. Conjugation of the donor and recipient strains resulted in a strain in which sections A and B are fully recoded. rK, rpsL-kanR double-selection cassette. b, Individual REXER of fragments 37a and 1 led to incomplete recoding. We carried out troubleshooting of both fragments independently (Extended Data Figs. 2, 4). The repairs are indicated with yellow and purple lines in fragment 37a and fragment 1, respectively. Each strain then served as a starting point for two independent sets of GENESIS; one generated $3 7 a - 3 7 b$ (on the left) and ended in an rpsL-kanR double-selection cassette, and one generated 1–3 (on the right) and ended in a sacB-cat double-selection cassette. We integrated an oriT (white triangle) $3 \mathrm { k b }$ upstream of the start of fragment 1, and this strain served as a donor for the directed conjugation of 1–3 into 37a–37b. The correct product was selected for by the gain of cat and the loss of rpsL. This resulted in the completion of section H in a single strain.

Diagram (a) illustrates a process involving genetic recombination. It shows two horizontal DNA strands labeled "Recipient" and "Donor". The recipient strand has a red flag labeled "+1" and a blue flag labeled "-2", indicating selection markers for genetic gain and loss. The donor strand has a green flag labeled "+4" and a yellow flag labeled "-3". An arrow labeled "Conjugation" points from the donor to the recipient, suggesting the transfer of genetic material. The process involves selecting for the gain of the green flag and the loss of the yellow flag, resulting in a new DNA strand with the red, green, and blue flags.

Diagram (b) is a flowchart representing the assembly of partially synthetic genomes. It shows a series of circular diagrams connected by arrows, indicating the sequence of genetic operations. Each circle represents a different stage of genome assembly, labeled with letters (A-G) and the letters inside the circles represent different genes or genetic elements. The circles are color-coded to match the flags in diagram (a), suggesting a relationship between the two diagrams. The process starts with the combination of "AB(r)" and "C(d)" to form "A-C(r)", and continues with further combinations and selections, resulting in increasingly complex genomes. The final product is a fully assembled genome labeled "A-G" with additional annotations indicating the sizes of the DNA fragments involved in the final steps (37a, 37ab, and 60 kb HR).

The key conclusion supported by these diagrams is the methodical assembly of synthetic genomes through a series of genetic recombination events, where specific genetic markers are used to select for desired genetic gains and losses. This process is likely used in the creation of genetically modified organisms or in the study of gene function and interaction.]

Extended Data Fig. 7 | Assembly of an organism with a fully synthetic genome through conjugation of recoded genome sections. a, Schematic assembly of partially synthetic donor and recipient genomes into a more-synthetic genome, through conjugation. In the recipient cell, the recoded genome section (pink) is extended with recoded DNA (dark pink)—commonly, 3–4 kb—by a lambda-red-mediated recombination and positive and negative selection; this step takes advantage of the genomic markers at the end of the recoded sequence that are introduced by GENESIS, and provides a homology region with the end of the recoded fragment in the donor strain. The donor strain is prepared by integration of an oriT at the end of the recoded DNA. The indicated positive and negative selection ensures the survival of recipient strains, and selects for recipients that have successfully integrated the synthetic DNA from the donor. An $\mathrm { F ^ { \prime } }$ plasmid that contains a mutation in the oriT sequence that makes it non-transferrable was used to facilitate conjugation of the donor genome to the recipient. $+ 2$ , cat; $^ { - 2 }$ , sacB; $+ 3 ,$ $H \dot { \gamma } g ^ { R }$ ; $^ { - 3 }$ , pheS∗; $+ 4 ,$ , aacC1 (a gene conferring gentamycin resistance); $+ 5$ , tetA (a gene

The homologous regions in the donor and recipient are both shown in dark pink. b, Synthetic genomic sections (pink) from multiple individual partially recoded genomes were assembled into a single fully recoded genome using conjugative assembly. The donor (d) and recipient (r) strains contain unique recoded genomic sections labelled in pink; recoded overlapping homology regions ( $3 \mathrm { k b }$ to $4 0 0 \mathrm { k b }$ in size) were used to seamlessly recombine the strains, and are shown in dark pink. Small homology regions ranging from 3 to $5 \mathrm { k b }$ in size are denoted with an asterisk. Conjugations for which we used greater than 5-kb homology (HR) are indicated. For assembly, the recoded genomic content from the donor was conjugated in a clockwise manner to replace the corresponding wild-type genomic section (grey) in the recipient. The origin of strain AB and strain H is described in detail in Extended Data Fig. 6; all other individual synthetic genomes were generated by GENESIS (Extended Data Fig. 1). Conjugation followed by recombination proceeded until the final fully recoded A–H strain was assembled and sequenceverified by next-generation sequencing.

Panel a is a bar graph comparing the doubling time of two cell lines, MDS42 and Syn61, under various conditions. The x-axis lists different media types (LB, LB Glu, M9, 2XTY) and temperatures (37°C, 42°C, 25°C), with an additional condition of LB Amp at 37°C. The y-axis measures doubling time in minutes. The bars are color-coded to represent the two cell lines, with Syn61 generally showing a shorter doubling time than MDS42 across most conditions, except for LB at 42°C where MDS42 has a shorter doubling time.

Panel b shows two phase-contrast microscopy images of bacterial colonies on agar plates. The left image is labeled MDS42, and the right image is labeled Syn61, with a condition of "serV -/+" indicating the presence or absence of a specific gene or factor. The Syn61 image shows more colonies than the MDS42 image.

Panel c is a histogram comparing the distribution of cell lengths for the same two cell lines, MDS42 and Syn61. The x-axis represents cell length in micrometers, and the y-axis represents the count of cells. The Syn61 cells have a broader distribution of lengths, with a peak around 2-3 micrometers, whereas MDS42 cells are more concentrated around 2 micrometers.

Panel d is a histogram showing the log2 ratio of protein numbers between Syn61 and MDS42. The x-axis represents the log2(Syn61/MDS42) ratio, and the y-axis represents the number of proteins. The distribution is centered around zero, indicating that the number of proteins in Syn61 and MDS42 is roughly equivalent, with a few proteins having a higher or lower ratio.

Overall, the image suggests that Syn61 cells have a faster growth rate, produce more colonies, and have a wider range of cell lengths compared to MDS42 cells. Additionally, the protein content between the two cell lines is quite similar.]  
Extended Data Fig. 8 | Characterization of an organism with a fully synthetic genome. a, Doubling times for Syn61 and MDS42. Our fully synthetic recoded $E$ . coli Syn61 has a doubling time that is $1 . 6 \times$ longer than that of $\mathrm { M D S } 4 2 ^ { 3 2 }$ , when grown in standard medium conditions $( 9 0 . 1 \mathrm { m i n } $ versus $5 7 . 6 \mathrm { m i n }$ in lysogeny broth $( \mathrm { L B } ) + 2 \%$ glucose). The ratio of growth rates between Syn61 and MDS42 in LB (decreased carbon catabolite repression) at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is 1.7, in M9 minimal medium is 1.7, in richer medium (2XTY) is 1.4, in LB at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is 2.5 and in LB at $4 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is 1.3. The doubling times in different medium conditions are: LB at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ , 58.3 min and $1 0 0 . 6 \mathrm { m i n }$ ; $\mathrm { L B } + 2 \%$ glucose, $5 7 . 6 \mathrm { m i n }$ and $9 0 . 1 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ; M9 minimal medium, $1 3 0 . 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ and $2 2 1 . 1 \mathrm { m i n }$ ; 2XTY, $6 8 . 2 \mathrm { m i n }$ and $9 2 . 6 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ; LB at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 86.3 min and $2 1 8 . 4 \mathrm { m i n }$ ; LB at $4 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , 77.4 min and $9 9 . 7 \mathrm { m i n }$ , for MDS42 and Syn61, respectively. Syn61 containing a plasmid without $( - )$ or with $( + )$ serV exhibited a growth-rate ratio of 0.99 $1 3 8 . 3 \mathrm { m i n }$ versus $1 3 6 . 2 \mathrm { m i n }$ ). Doubling times represent the average of ten independently grown biological replicates of each strain, and are shown as mean $\pm$ s.d. (see Supplementary Methods). The data for individual experiments are represented by dots. b, Representative microscopy images   
of E. coli strain MDS42 and Syn61. Samples were imaged on an upright Zeiss Axiophot phase-contrast microscope using a $6 3 \times 1 . 2 5$ NA Plan Neofluar phase objective (see Supplementary Methods). The experiment was performed twice with similar results. c, Histogram of cell lengths quantified from microscopy images of strains MDS42 and Syn61. The mean cell length $( \pm s . \mathbf { d . } )$ for MDS42 was $1 . 9 7 \pm 0 . 5 7 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and for Syn61 was $2 . 3 \pm 0 . 7 4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ . Images of $n = 5 0 0$ cells were taken during exponential growth phase for both strains. Cell-length measurements were made using Nikon NIS Elements software (see Supplementary Methods). A 1- $\mu \mathrm { m }$ lower size limit was imposed to remove background particulates and dust from quantification; this also precludes quantification of extracellular vesicles. d, Label-free quantification of the MDS42 and Syn61 proteomes. Each strain was grown in three biological replicates. Each biological replicate was analysed by tandem mass spectrometry in technical duplicate. Technical duplicates of biological replicates were merged. A total of 1,084 proteins was quantified across the samples. No protein quantified in both MDS42 and Syn61 differed in abundance—as judged by label-free quantification values—by more than 1.16-fold.

Here's a detailed description of each section:

a. This section shows a schematic representation of a gene synthesis process. It compares the wild-type (WT) genome with a recorded genome (Syn61). The diagram highlights the codon usage differences, with specific codons like TCG, TGC, TCC, etc., being replaced by others like AGT, AGC, etc., to optimize expression in a heterologous system. The genes RF1 and RF2 are indicated, with the RF2 gene being truncated in the Syn61 genome.

b. This graph plots the maximum growth percentage of Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells transformed with plasmids containing either the anticodon UGA or the synonymous codon changes (Syn61). The x-axis represents the concentration of 5-cyanopyridine-3-carboxylic acid (CYPK) in millimolar (mM), and the y-axis shows the percentage of maximum growth. The plot indicates that cells with the Syn61 changes grow better at higher CYPK concentrations compared to those with the anticodon UGA.

c. Similar to graph b, this graph compares the maximum growth percentage of E. coli cells with plasmids containing either the anticodon GCU or the Syn61 changes. Again, the Syn61 changes show improved growth at higher CYPK concentrations.

d. This diagram illustrates the genetic manipulation of the yccA gene. Two junctions are shown, with the first junction displaying the wild-type (WT) sequence and the second junction showing the Syn61 changes. The diagram includes the genes serT and hyaA, with arrows indicating the direction of transcription.

e. This section shows the genetic manipulation of the hemA gene. It includes two junctions, with the first junction showing the WT sequence and the second junction showing the Syn61 changes. The diagram includes the genes prfA and pmmC, with arrows indicating the direction of transcription. Below the diagram is a gel electrophoresis image showing the PCR products for different clones, with the expected sizes indicated on the left.

f. This diagram illustrates the genetic manipulation of the yodB gene. It includes two junctions, with the first junction showing the WT sequence and the second junction showing the Syn61 changes. The diagram includes the genes serU and yeel, with arrows indicating the direction of transcription. Below the diagram is a gel electrophoresis image showing the PCR products for different clones, with the expected sizes indicated on the left.

Extended Data Fig. 9 | Consequences of synonymous codon compression in Syn61. a, Synonymous codon compression and deletion of $p r f A$ , serU and serT in E. coli. The grey boxes shows the E. coli serine codons and stop codons, together with the tRNAs and release factors that decode them in wild-type E. coli (WT genome). tRNA anticodons and release factors are connected to the codons that they are predicted to read by black lines. The tRNA and release factor genes are shown in the black boxes. Synonymous codon compression (syn. codon. comp.) leads to Syn61 cells with a recoded genome (pink boxes), in which TCG and TCA codons are removed. The abundance of each codon is listed in its box. b, As in Fig. 4b, but with the M. mazei $\mathrm { P y l R S / t R N A ^ { P y l } u g a }$ pair (anticodon UGA). There are fewer cognate codons to this anticodon in Syn61 than in MDS42; CYPK addition might therefore be expected to be less toxic in Syn61, as observed. c, As in Fig. 4b, but with the M. mazei PylRS/tRNAPylGCU pair (anticodon GCU). There are a greater number of cognate codons to this anticodon in Syn61 than in MDS42; CYPK addition might therefore be expected to be more toxic in Syn61, as observed. d, serT (dark grey) is deleted by insertion of a $\large P h e S * - H y g ^ { R }$ double-selection cassette (black) via lambda-red-mediated recombination. Recombination yields new junctions 1 and 2, indicated by green and blue bars. For each recombination, both junctions were sequence-verified by Sanger sequencing. Above the Sanger chromatograms, the arrows indicate the precise location of the junction, the blue bar indicates the sequence that corresponds to the selection cassette and the green bar corresponds to the genomic sequence that flanks the selection cassette. The primers used to generate selection cassettes with suitable homologies to serU, serT and prfA for recombination are provided in Supplementary Data 21. The experiment was performed once. e, prfA (dark grey) is deleted by the insertion of an rpsL-kanR double-selection cassette (in black) via lambda-red-mediated homologous recombination. The agarose gels are annotated as described in Fig. 4c, and the rest of the data are annotated as described in d. The experiment was performed once. f, serU (dark grey) is deleted by insertion of a $P h e S * - H y g ^ { R }$ double-selection cassette (in black) via lambda-red-mediated recombination.

Graph (a) is a bar graph showing the size of various genomes in megabases (Mb). The x-axis lists different chromosomes of S. cerevisiae (I-XII) and three other organisms (M. genitalium, M. mycoides, and E. coli). The y-axis represents the size of the genomes, ranging from 0 to 3 Mb. The bars indicate that E. coli has the largest genome size among the listed organisms, followed by the various chromosomes of S. cerevisiae, with M. genitalium and M. mycoides having smaller genomes.

Graph (b) is titled "Genome Recoding" and shows the percentage of recoded target codons in one organism. The x-axis lists different codon changes (e.g., TTA, TTG, AGY, AGA, AGG, TAG) for two organisms: S. typhimurium (S. typ.) and E. coli. The y-axis represents the number of recoded target codons, ranging from 0 to 20,000. The bars show that E. coli has a significantly higher number of recoded codons, particularly for the codon changes TCA, TCG, and TAG, compared to S. typhimurium.

Graph (c) is titled "Non-programmed Mutations" and illustrates the rate of non-programmed mutations per target codon. The x-axis lists the same codon changes as graph (b) for two organisms: S. typhimurium (S. typ.) and E. coli. The y-axis represents the rate of non-programmed mutations, ranging from 0.0001 to 10 per target codon. The bars indicate that E. coli has a higher rate of non-programmed mutations for most codon changes compared to S. typhimurium, with the highest rates observed for AGA and AGG codon changes.

The key conclusions that can be drawn from these graphs are that E. coli has a larger genome and higher rates of recoded codons and non-programmed mutations compared to the other organisms and S. cerevisiae chromosomes. This suggests that E. coli may have a more dynamic genome with higher mutation rates.]

The checklist contains several items, each marked with a checkbox, indicating whether they are essential or optional components of the report. Here's a detailed description of each item:

1. **Exact Sample Size**: This item is marked as essential (indicated by a checked box). It requires the report to specify the exact sample size (n) for each experimental group or condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement.

2. **Measurement Statement**: Also marked as essential, this item requires a statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly.

3. **Statistical Tests**: This item is marked as essential and specifies that the statistical test(s) used should be identified, along with whether they are one- or two-sided. It notes that only common tests should be described by name, and more complex techniques should be described in the Methods section.

4. **Covariates Description**: This item is marked as essential and requires a description of all covariates tested.

5. **Assumptions or Corrections**: This item is marked as essential and calls for a description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustments for multiple comparisons.

6. **Statistical Parameters**: This item is marked as essential and requires a full description of the statistical parameters, including central tendency (e.g., means) or other basic estimates (e.g., regression coefficients) and variation (e.g., standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals).

7. **Null Hypothesis Testing**: This item is marked as optional (indicated by an unchecked box). It specifies that for null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g., F, t, r) should be provided with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom, and P value noted. It also suggests giving P values as exact values whenever suitable.

8. **Bayesian Analysis**: This item is marked as optional and requires information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings for Bayesian analysis.

9. **Hierarchical and Complex Designs**: This item is marked as optional and calls for the identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes for hierarchical and complex designs.

10. **Effect Sizes**: This item is marked as optional and requires estimates of effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated.

The checklist is designed to ensure comprehensive and transparent reporting of statistical methods and results in scientific research.]
