With metabolic models for 35 organisms already available (http://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/ In_Silico_Organisms/Other_Organisms) and high-throughput technologies enabling the construction of many more each year5-7, FBA is an important tool for harnessing the knowledge encoded in these models.

Growth is incorporated into the reconstruction with a biomass reaction (yellow column), which simulates metabolites consumed during biomass production. Exchange reactions (green columns) are used to represent the flow of metabolites, such as glucose and oxygen, in and out of the cell. (c) At steady state, the flux through each reaction is given by $\\mathtt { S v } = 0$ which defines a system of linear equations. As large models contain more reactions than metabolites, there is more than one possible solution to these equations.

In practice, when only one reaction, such as biomass production, is desired for maximization or minimization, c is a vector of zeros with a value of 1 at the position of the reaction of interest.
