Due to the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based research through the distribution of freely available software. ",

These constraints include compartmentalization, mass conservation, molecular crowding [11], thermodynamic directionality [12], and transcription factor activity [13]. More recently, transcriptome data have been used to reduce the size of the set of computed feasible states [14-17]. Because constraints-based models are often underdetermined they may provide multiple mathematically-equivalent solutions to a specific question – these equivalent solutions must be assessed with experimental data for biological relevance [18].

While the COBRA Toolbox has gained widespread use and become a powerful piece of software, it was not designed to cope with modeling complex biological processes outside of metabolism or for integrated analyses of omics data, and requires proprietary software to function. To drive COBRA research through this avalanche of omics and model increasingly complex biological processes [10], we have developed an object-oriented implementation of core COBRA Toolbox functions using the Python programming language.

Moreover, COBRApy inherits numerous benefits from the Python language, and allows the integration of models with databases and other sources of high-throughput data.
