Engineers seek to harness this capability to program cells to perform tasks or create chemicals and materials that match the complexity seen in nature. This Review describes new tools that aid the construction of genetic circuits. Circuit dynamics can be influenced by the choice of regulators and changed with expression 'tuning knobs'. We collate the failure modes encountered when assembling circuits, quantify their impact on performance and review mitigation efforts. Finally, we discuss the constraints that arise from circuits having to operate within a living cell. Collectively, better tools, well-characterized parts and a comprehensive understanding of how to compose circuits are leading to a breakthrough in the ability to program living cells for advanced applications, from living therapeutics to the atomic manufacturing of functional materials.

In the short term, the production of bio-based chemicals can be improved by timing gene expression at different stages of fermentation or by turning on an enzyme only under particular conditions (e.g., high cell density)1-6. As circuits become more advanced, entire algorithms from control theory could be implemented to improve biochemical production7-16 (Fig. 1a). Synthetic regulation is also an important tool for the discovery of natural products including pharmaceuticals, insecticides and entirely new classes of chemicals. Accessing these products may require synthetic regulation because many of the relevant gene clusters are 'silent, meaning that the conditions under which they are induced are unknown17-22. Outside of the fermenter, living cells could be programmed to serve as therapeutic agents that correct genetic disease (Fig. Ib) or colonize niches in the human microbiome to perform a therapeutic function23-35 (Fig. 1c).

        "text": "Several features of genetic circuits make them challenging to work with, relative to other areas of genetic engineering. First, circuits require the precise balancing of their component regulators to generate the proper response46,47. Computational tools and part libraries that enable the tuning of expression levels have been developed only recently48–51. Before this, only course-grained control was achievable with small sets of parts46,47,52. Second, many circuits are difficult to screen in directed-evolution experiments for correct performance. Digital logic has clear ON and OFF states that can form the basis for a screen12,53–59. However, screening for dynamic circuits, such as oscillators, is significantly more complex60, and it is hard to imagine how screens would be established for more sophisticated functions, such as a PID (proportional integral derivative) controller with proscribed response properties. Third, there are few tools to measure circuit performance. Typically, a fluorescent reporter is used to measure the output, but fluorescence detection requires artificially high expression, and fluorescent protein degradation rates can limit the ability to measure dynamics. Fourth, synthetic circuits are very sensitive to environment, growth conditions and genetic context in ways that are poorly understood61. Finally, the process of building a large genetic circuit requires the assembly of many DNA parts, and this process has been both technically challenging (until recently) and fraught with its own sources of errors58,62–67.

Analogously, the CRISPRi system uses the Cas9 protein to bind to the DNA and alter transcription78,79.

These gates are based on unidirectional serine integrases without excisionases and therefore operate as memory circuits that record exposure to two input signals. Once flipped, the circuits cannot be returned to their original state; therefore, the gates do not distinguish the order in which they were exposed to the inputs or even whether the inputs occurred at the same time.

Mutant Cas proteins (such as dCas9 (ref. 79) and $\\mathrm { C a s 9 _ { N - } }$ (ref. 127)) that do not have nuclease activity have been developed and used as transcription factors that knock down gene expression by forming a DNA bubble that interferes with RNAP activity78,79.

Toxicity is less noticeable when Cas9 is used as a nuclease because the RNA is in excess, but in a circuit Cas9 would need to be able to be carried in an RNA-free state before the gate is turned on. Another consideration for building CRISPRi circuits is retroactivity138, which could arise from using Cas9 as a shared resource (see \"Common failure modes from connecting circuits\" below).

In the natural system, RNA-OUT binds to a specific sequence at the $5 ^ { \\prime }$ end of an mRNA (RNA-IN) to occlude ribosome binding and increase mRNA degradation140-142. Arkin and coworkers retooled this system to repress transcription, instead of translation, using a transcriptional adaptor from the tna operon80. The tna regulatory element is composed of a ribosome-binding site (RBS), the coding sequence for a short peptide called TnaC, a Rho factor-binding site and an RNAP pause site that facilitates Rho-mediated transcription termination. Translation of tnaC causes ribosomal stalling, which blocks Rho factor binding and allows RNAP to transcribe genes downstream of tnaC. However, when translation of tnaC is prohibited by the RNA-IN/OUT system, Rho binds the growing mRNA and knocks off RNAP, thereby inhibiting transcription elongation. As with CRISPRi, the adapted RNA-IN/OUT system could be used to generate a large set of orthogonal regulators because it is based on designable RNA-RNA interactions. To date, more than 150 different families of at least seven orthogonal RNA-IN/OUT mutants have been designed using the RNA-IN/ OUT model, and all of the mutants tested experimentally have been functional and orthogonal81.

Increased cooperativity makes connecting gates easier by decreasing the range of input needed from an upstream circuit to span the induction threshold of the next circuit in the series. One way to make a gate more switchlike is to change the cooperativity of repressor binding to the promoter or to introduce DNA looping159,160. Another approach is to express a sequestering molecule that binds a circuit component and prevents it from functioning. Sequestration has been achieved using sRNAs that bind to mRNA 161,162 (Fig. 3f), proteins that bind to transcription factors113,163,164, and decoy DNA operators that titrate the transcription factor away from the output promoter165 (Fig. 3g).
