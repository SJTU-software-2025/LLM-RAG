Understanding the origins of cell organization thus requires us to answer the question of how the self-organizing physical and biochemical properties of cellular constituents can convert simple temporal changes in gene-expression levels into complex changes in physical, three-dimensional structures.

We note that our use of the term does not imply the existence of a 'designer, but given the current interest in synthetic biology we suggest that the design principles used in evolution could now be used to reprogramme cell in a rational way. For example, we argue that a common strategy used by cell to regulate organelle size is to limit either the assembly or disassembly rate of an organelle by a process that is inherently dependent on organelle size. Other specific principles that we discuss are the control of organelle number by the balance of organelle formation and partitioning; the establishment of cellular polarity by self-organization that is biased by external inputs; the control of organelle position by direct motion on polarized cytoskeletal arrays; and the control of organelle shape by membrane-binding proteins that drive local curvature changes.

For example, if fl agella double in number, then the average length of each flagellum should halve. However, mutants with varying numbers of fl agella show a signifi cantly weaker dependence of flagellar length on numberl6.

If there is only one size at which the assembly rate equals the disassembly rate then this will be the steady-state organelle size (FIC. 2a). For example, eukaryotic flagellar microtubules undergo continuous assembly and disassembly at their tips. Of these, the disassembly rate is length-independent and the assembly rate is a decreasing function of length16,21. Longer flagella assemble slower than shorter fl agella because transport within the flagellum, which is mediated by a kinesin-based system called intraflagellar transport22, becomes less efficient16,21. This limits the availability of precursor protein to support tip assembly, thus reducing the assembly rate with increasing length. As the rate of assembly is a continuously decreasing function of length (whereas the rate of disassembly is length-independent), there is only one length at which the two rates balance, and this sets the steady-state flagellar length.

It has been proposed, for example, that the synthesis of chloroplasts is regulated as a function of the number of chloroplasts in algal cells28. Cells that inherit too few chloroplasts will make more, whereas cells that inherit too many will stop chloroplast synthesis. A similar scheme has been experimentally demonstrated for centrioles29.

Peroxisomes undergo highly regulated proliferation, the rate of which is adjusted in response to unknown intracellular cues that control steady-state peroxisome number'. Apparently, cells can detect whether the organelle number has drifted outside of a preset range. One possible mechanism by which cells count organelle number would be for the organelles to generate a diffusible molecular signal at a constant rate per organelle. This signalling molecule would degrade with a constant half-life. As a result, the steady-state concentration of the signal would be proportional to the number of organelles. The concentration could then be used to regulate the assembly of new organelles. One such mechanism seems to function in the control of plasmid replication, in which plasmids encode diffusible trans-acting autoinhibitors of plasmid replication at a constant rate per plasmid³2.

For example, endosomes and lysosomes associate with spindle poles but still distribute according to binomial statistics34. Golgi segregate using the mitotic spindle poles in some organisms35, whereas in others they fragment and scatter randomly between the daughters36. It should be noted that partitioning by the spindle will not necessarily reduce fluctuations in organelle numbers if individual organelles associate with the spindle poles at random³7.

In the case of keratocytes, spontaneous myosin-dependent actin contractility at the presumptive rear of the cell leads to the increased inward flow of fi lamentous (F)-actin and the retraction of the rear. These changes in F-actin organization and dynamics propagate globally and result in the decrease of F-actin flow at the cell rear and the induction of actin-polymerization-based protrusion at the front of the cell, thus leading to persistent keratocyte motility5. The common design principle in establishing cell polarity seems to be the existence of intrinsic selforganizing polarity systems, in which the cell exhibits fluctuating asymmetry in the localization of signalling proteins or cytoskeletal dynamics. The cell then responds to a stochastic amplification in these fluctuations by initiating a positive-feedback loop, which involves both signalling networks and cytoskeletal structures that locally amplify the initial symmetry-breaking event and further regulate other mechanochemical polarizing processes throughout the cell(FIC. 3a,b). Positive feedback alone would lead to constant uniform activation of polarizing processes. Therefore, polarization to a discrete site also requires long-range negative interactions to suppress the spread of polarization43,46.

Organelles might move by random diffusion until they collide with a target docking site, although it is unclear whether the diffusion of organelles in the crowded cytoplasm is fast enough to allow such a diffuse-to-capture mechanism to operate53-56 Perhaps for this reason, organelle positioning often involves the cytoskeleton, which can allow for more rapid, directed transport of organelles by motor proteins or specific subcellular localization through the regulation of cytoskeletal distribution and dynamics. For example, cortical actin flow drives the polarized redistribution of the cortical ER and myoplasm (mitochondrially enriched cytoplasm) in Ascidian oocytes57 and establishes the nucleus-centrosome axis in migrating cells during wound healing58.

The cisternal compartments of the Golgi have a polarized organization, and their orientation depends on the cell type and on both dynein and kinesin molecular motors moving on polarized microtubules65. For example, in motile cells the trans-Golgi network (TGN), from which vesicles that are destined for the plasma membrane bud, is orientated towards the outside of the cell, whereas the cis-Golgi is orientated inward. The TGN has been shown to harbour microtubule-nucleation ability and Golgi-attached microtubules exhibit increased stability68. It was recently further shown that the TGN protein GCC185 recruits CLASPs (CLIP-associated proteins), which stabilize small microtubule seeds that are nucleated at the TGN6%. This leads to a population of stabilized microtubules emanating from the TGN, preferentially towards the leading edge69, which might be required for cell motility70. Thus, the positioning of the Golgi in response to cell polarity might itself contribute further to processes that promote cell polarity.

The famous experiments of Beisson and Sonneborn on inverted ciliary rows in Paramecium aurelia clearly show that artificially rearranged structures can be propagated through division114. This phenomenon has been extensively investigated with a series of elegant experiments in various types of ciliates, which have shown that certain aspects of a rearranged organization can be inherited and other rearrangements can selfcorrect. An example is provided by the oral apparatus, a spiral-shaped array of cilia. The oral apparatus is a polarized structure with a distinct anterior and posterior end, and is also chiral, showing a pronounced left–right asymmetry. When the oral apparatus is repositioned to different places in the cell, it retains its normal left–right asymmetry but switches its anterior-posterior asymmetry in response to the new cellular context. This suggests that the structure relies strictly on local self-propagating cues for left–right position but responds to global cellular cues for anterior-posterior positioning15. This has been interpreted as reflecting a varying level of input of local information (which can be rearranged and thus propagated) for some aspects of structure compared with global cellular polarity information (which cannot be rearranged by local manipulations and therefore cannot be propagated). If genomic tools could be used to probe the underlying events of these rearrangements, they might aid the understanding of the origins of cellular geometry and its propagation. ",
