        "text": "ABSTRACT Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) has been used in the past to analyze microbial metabolic networks. Typically, FBA is used to study the metabolic flux at a particular steady state of the system. However, there are many situations where the reprogramming of the metabolic network is important. Therefore, the dynamics of these metabolic networks have to be studied. In this paper, we have extended FBA to account for dynamics and present two different formulations for dynamic FBA. These two approaches were used in the analysis of diauxic growth in Escherichia coli. Dynamic FBA was used to simulate the batch growth of E. coli on glucose, and the predictions were found to qualitatively match experimental data. The dynamic FBA formalism was also used to study the sensitivity to the objective function. It was found that an instantaneous objective function resulted in better predictions than a terminal-type objective function. The constraints that govern the growth at different phases in the batch culture were also identified. Therefore, dynamic FBA provides a framework for analyzing the transience of metabolism due to metabolic reprogramming and for obtaining insights for the design of metabolic networks. ",

The next logical step is to use this information to study the integrated behavior of the cellular networks. One of the areas of research has been the study of metabolic networks (Oh and Liao, 2000; Tao et al., 2001; Ideker et al., 2001). The analytical and experimental methods for understanding the nature of flux distribution in a metabolic network, along with molecular biology techniques for genetic engineering, assist in the design of the metabolic reaction networks (Stephanpoulos, 1999). Mathematical analysis of metabolism can guide the metabolic engineering process; for example, Hatzimanikatis et al. (1998) have addressed the problem of determining the optimal regulatory structure in terms of gene overexpression or deletion. In that study, the regulatory structure was represented by binary variables, and the objective was to maximize a desired steady-state objective through the solution of a mixed integer linear programming formulation. Several other quantitative approaches have been proposed to study metabolic networks. These approaches include metabolic control analysis (Fell, 1996), biochemical systems theory (Savageau et al., 1987a,b), cybernetic modeling (Kompala, 1984; Dhurjati et al., 1985; Varner and Ramkrishna, 1999), and flux balance analysis (FBA) (Varma and Palsson, 1994b). With the exception of FBA, these approaches require a functional form for the kinetics of the cellular reactions. ",

Ramkrishna and coworkers have also used the cybernetic modeling approach to model the diauxic growth of $E$ . coli on mixtures of glucose and organic acids such as pyruvate, succinate, and fumarate (Ramakrishna et al., 1996; Narang et al., 1997). In cybernetic modeling, the bacterial cell is viewed as an optimal strategist that maximizes the utility of the resources provided to it. The regulation of the genes and the activity of the enzymes are obtained as a solution to an optimal resource allocation problem. Because these variables are obtained as a function of the kinetic rate equations, the result is a closed-form dynamic model of the network. ",

Because the system of linear equations is underdetermined (more unknown fluxes than equations), an objective function is used to obtain a solution using linear programming (LP). Typically, the maximization of the growth flux is used as the objective function (Varma and Palsson, 1994a; Bonarius et al., 1997; Pramanik and Keasling, 1997; Edwards et al., 2001), where the growth flux is defined in terms of the biosynthetic requirements. For details on the LP formulation, see Varma and Palsson (1994a), and Edwards et al. (1999). FBA only identifies the metabolic flux distribution, and there is no information on the metabolite concentrations or on the dynamic characteristics of the metabolic fluxes. In simulations where there is a transition between two steady states, the FBA solution will indicate an instantaneous change of the metabolic fluxes (Varma and Palsson, 1994b). Therefore, constraints on the rate of change of the fluxes must be explicitly incorporated in the problem. The dynamic extension to FBA can be formulated in the following two ways.

        "text": "DFBA using SOA extended the FBA approach presented in Varma and Palsson (1994b) through the incorporation of the flux rate-of-change constraints. In this paper, the model for diauxic growth of $E$ . coli considered the effect of oxygen transport, and the metabolic network studied was simplified using pathway analysis to obtain a compact representation. The scope of the results obtained for modeling the metabolic reprogramming during diauxic growth presented here were similar to those based on FBA. Cybernetic models have also been proposed for the study of diauxic growth (Ramakrishna et al., 1996; Narang et al., 1997). The fluxes in the cybernetic approach are obtained as a solution to an optimal resource allocation problem with an instantaneous objective function. Typically, only a subset of the network is considered in the optimization problem (Varner, 2000). The solution obtained is analytic, and one can represent the system with a dynamic model. However, the cybernetic approach requires kinetic information for all the reactions in the network. DFBA does not require kinetic information and considers the entire network, although the solution for the fluxes is not analytic and is obtained by solving an optimization problem. ",

        "text": "DFBA using DOA allows the formulation of a dynamic objective function describing characteristics, such as, reduction of transition time between metabolic states (Torres, 1994) or end-point biomass optimization, into a rigorous mathematical framework. A dynamic objective function based on the desired goal could provide information useful in the design of genetically modified metabolic networks for metabolic engineering by taking into account the dynamic responses to fluctuations in the system. The static optimization-based DFBA would not allow such a dynamic formulation, because the optimization performed is at a specific time instant. However, in SOA, the number of variables that have to be solved is far fewer (in each optimization) in comparison, and the optimization problem is an LP problem as opposed to the NLP for DOA. As the size of the network increases, the number of variables and the number of constraints would increase proportionally in the NLP. Thus, SOA is scalable to larger metabolic networks. ",

        "text": "DFBA provides a framework for modeling the dynamic responses of a metabolic network to various perturbations. In this paper, we have examined the applicability of this framework for modeling the diauxic growth in $E$ . coli. The results from DFBA are qualitatively similar to the experimental observations. DFBA was able to predict the onset of acetate production and also the preference of $E$ . coli for sequential utilization of acetate and glucose over the simultaneous utilization. The constraints governing the behavior were identified at various phases in the batch culture. It was found that, in the initial phase, the glucose and oxygen uptake rates were the active constraints. In the middle phase, the oxygen concentration is close to zero, and the mass transfer coefficient $( k _ { \\mathrm { L } } a )$ and the maximum allowed rate of change of flux was found to constrain the system. Acetate utilization (last phase) was found to be constrained completely by the oxygen mass transfer coefficient. ",

The importance of the objective function was examined, and it was found that an instantaneous objective function was more representative of the experimental results than an end-point objective function. Another advantage of dFBA is that can incorporate kinetic expressions for reactions that are well-studied. This approach could also be used to identify regulatory phenomena and obtain insight into the functioning of the metabolic pathways. Changes in the regulatory structure that optimize the dynamics of a particular metabolic process could be obtained as a solution to a modified DFBA problem. ",

These tools, along with experimental technologies such as microarrays, GeneChips, and proteomics, will help further understanding of the dynamic behavior of metabolic networks. Additionally, the DFBA approach can be used to provide strategies for the design of a network with a desired objective for metabolic engineering. Finally, the DFBA approach is an extension to classical FBA and has demonstrated great potential; however, further analysis is needed to improve the predictive capabilities in the biological sciences.
